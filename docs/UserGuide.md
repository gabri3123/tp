# User Guide

## 1. Introduction

**TradeLog** provides a CLI-based, systematic way to log trades and test systems that is faster and more efficient than logging trades on Google Sheets. It has the ability to automatically calculate trade details such as Risk:Reward ratio, ROI, and the Expected Value (EV) of the system across varying timeframes. By eliminating the friction of manual spreadsheet entry, TradeLog helps traders maintain a disciplined journal and identify their mathematical edge with precision.
