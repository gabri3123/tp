## 2. Design & Implementation

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

TradeLog follows a modular CLI architecture, separating concerns into four main components:

* **Logic**: Handles prefix-based command parsing (e.g., `t/`, `d/`) and execution flow for commands.
* **Model**: Encapsulates the `Trade` entity and the `TradeList` collection, handling in-memory data representation and ROI calculations.
* **Storage**: Implements an **immediate-save mechanism**. After every successful state-changing command (add, edit, delete), the data is persisted to `tradelog.txt`.
* **UI**: Manages formatted console output and user interaction.

The diagram below shows the high-level flow of a user command through the system:

### 2.2 Design & Implementation

#### 2.2.1 UI Component

##### Architecture-Level Description

The `Ui` class is TradeLog's sole output layer. All console interaction — welcome banners, trade displays, error messages, and performance summaries — is centralised here. No other class calls `System.out` directly. This single-responsibility design means that if the output format ever needs to change (e.g., migrating from CLI to a GUI), only `Ui` needs to be modified.

The `Ui` class depends on the `TradeList` and `Trade` model classes for display purposes but has no dependency on `Storage`, `Parser`, or any `Command`. This keeps coupling low and makes the class independently testable.

##### Component-Level Description

`Ui` exposes the following categories of methods:

| Method Category    | Examples                                                          | Purpose                            |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Lifecycle messages | `showWelcome()`, `showGoodbye()`                                  | Displayed on startup and exit      |
| Trade display      | `printTradeList(TradeList)`, `printTrade(Trade)`                  | Format and print trade data        |
| Feedback messages  | `showTradeAdded()`, `showTradeDeleted()`, `showTradeUpdated(int)` | Confirm successful operations      |
| Summary display    | `showSummary(...)`, `showSummaryEmpty()`                          | Render performance metrics         |
| Error display      | `showError(String)`                                               | Wrap all errors in a divider block |

All output is framed with a fixed 80-character divider line (`DIVIDER`) produced by `"-".repeat(80)`. This gives the CLI a consistent visual structure and separates logical output blocks for readability.

Logging is embedded at the `INFO` level for successful operations and `WARNING` level for errors, using `java.util.logging.Logger`. This means that all UI interactions are traceable in the log output without polluting the console.

 │                │◄──────────────│───────────────│            │
```

##### Design Rationale

The alternative considered was to have each `Command` class print directly to `System.out`. This was rejected because:

1. It would scatter output logic across many classes, making visual consistency hard to enforce.
2. Unit testing would require capturing `System.out` in every command test rather than in one place.
3. Changing the output format (e.g., adding colour codes, or redirecting to a file) would require modifying every command.

Centralising in `Ui` means tests can use a `MockUi` subclass (as seen in `DeleteCommandTest` and `SummaryCommandTest`) to intercept output and assert on values without any `System.out` redirection overhead.

---

#### 2.2.2 ListCommand

##### Architecture-Level Description

`ListCommand` is one of the six core commands in v1.0. It is the simplest non-trivial command: it takes no arguments, performs no mutation of state, and delegates entirely to `Ui` for output. Its role is to bridge the user's request to view all trades with the display logic in `Ui`.

It extends `Command`, the abstract base class that defines the `execute(TradeList, Ui, Storage)` contract. Because `ListCommand` does not exit the application, it inherits the default `isExit()` return value of `false`.

##### Component-Level Description

```
«abstract»
Command
    │
    └── ListCommand
            │
            └── execute(tradeList, ui, storage)
                    │
                    └── ui.printTradeList(tradeList)
```

The `execute` method:

1. Asserts that `tradeList` and `ui` are non-null (defensive programming).
2. Logs the trade count at `INFO` level before delegation.
3. Calls `ui.printTradeList(tradeList)`, which handles both the empty-list case and the populated-list case.
4. Logs successful completion.

The `storage` parameter is accepted by the method signature (to satisfy the `Command` contract) but is deliberately unused, as listing trades requires no persistence interaction.

    │                │                 │ [else]             │
    │                │                 │  loop i=0..size-1  │

    │◄───────────────│                 │                    │
```

##### Design Rationale

An alternative considered was to have `ListCommand` access `TradeList` directly and format the output itself. This was rejected for the same centralisation reason described in the `Ui` section: it would duplicate formatting logic and make the output inconsistent with other commands. The current design keeps `ListCommand` as a thin orchestrator — it knows *when* to display trades, but not *how*.

---

#### 2.2.3 AddCommand

##### Architecture-Level Description

The `AddCommand` is a core state-changing operation responsible for introducing new trades into the TradeLog system. It acts as the primary bridge between the `Parser` component (which supplies the raw user input), the `Model` component (by instantiating new `Trade` objects and updating the in-memory `TradeList`), and the `Storage` component (triggering the immediate-save mechanism to persist the new data).

To adhere to the principle of Separation of Concerns, the execution of the `add` feature is explicitly split into two distinct phases: an initialization/validation phase, and an execution/mutation phase.

##### Component-Level Description

1. Construction & Validation Phase: When the user inputs an `add` command, the `Parser` creates a new `AddCommand(String arguments)`. The constructor immediately passes the raw string to the `ArgumentTokeniser` to map prefixes to their respective string values. It then utilizes `ParserUtil` to strictly validate the financial logic of the inputs (e.g., ensuring a `long` position does not have a stop-loss higher than the entry price, and checking that all prices are valid positive numbers). If any validation fails during this step, a `TradeLogException` is thrown before the `TradeList` or `Storage` is ever accessed.

2. Execution Phase: Once the `AddCommand` is successfully instantiated with a fully valid `Trade` object held in its internal state, the main loop calls `execute(tradeList, ui, storage)`. The command appends the new trade to the `TradeList`, triggers the `Ui` to display a confirmation message with the formatted trade details, and implicitly relies on the main loop's architecture to save the newly updated state to the text file.

```
##### Design Rationale

The alternative considered having the constructor simply store the raw user string, pushing all tokenizing and validation inside `execute()`. This was rejected because it violates the Single Responsibility Principle. It would bloat the `execute()` method with string manipulation, financial logic validation, memory updates, and UI updates all at once, making unit testing significantly more difficult.

#### 2.2.4 Testing Strategy for `Ui` and `ListCommand`

Both `Ui` and `ListCommand` are tested using a `captureOutput` helper that temporarily redirects `System.out` to a `ByteArrayOutputStream`. This pattern avoids any dependency on mocking frameworks and works natively with JUnit 5.

The three `UiTest` cases cover:
- Empty list rendering (`printTradeList` with no trades).
- Welcome message format (`showWelcome`).
- Error message wrapping (`showError`).

The two `ListCommandTest` cases cover:
- That the command correctly delegates to `Ui` and produces the empty-list message.
- That `isExit()` returns `false`, confirming it does not terminate the application.

Both test classes confirm that **no state is mutated** by these components — they are pure output operations.

#### 2.2.5 [v2.0] Strategy Shortcut Expansion Feature

##### Overview

Power users who log tens of trades per session type strategy names frequently. To reduce friction, v2.0 introduces **strategy shortcut expansion**: a set of predefined abbreviations that are automatically expanded to their full strategy names before a trade is saved.

The supported shortcuts are:

| Shortcut | Expanded Strategy Name |
|----------|------------------------|
| `BB`     | Breakout               |
| `TBF`    | Trend Bar Failure      |
| `PB`     | Pullback               |
| `MTR`    | Major Trend Reversal   |
| `HOD`    | High of Day            |
| `LOD`    | Low of Day             |
| `MR`     | Mean Reversion         |
| `TR`     | Trading Range          |
| `DB`     | Double Bottom          |
| `DT`     | Double Top             |

##### Implementation

The expansion is implemented as a static lookup in a new utility method `ParserUtil.expandStrategyShortcut(String)`. This method is called inside `ParserUtil`'s strategy parsing pipeline, which is already invoked by `AddCommand` and `EditCommand`.

The method uses a `HashMap<String, String>` constant, `STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS`, defined at the class level:

```java
private static final Map<String, String> STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS = new HashMap<>();

static {
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("BB",  "Breakout");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("TBF", "Trend Bar Failure");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("PB",  "Pullback");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("MTR", "Major Trend Reversal");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("HOD", "High of Day");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("LOD", "Low of Day");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("MR",  "Mean Reversion");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("TR",  "Trading Range");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("DB",  "Double Bottom");
    STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.put("DT",  "Double Top");
}

public static String expandStrategyShortcut(String raw) {
    String upper = raw.trim().toUpperCase();
    return STRATEGY_SHORTCUTS.getOrDefault(upper, raw.trim());
}
```

If the input does not match any known shortcut, it is returned unchanged. This means custom strategy names (e.g., `Gap Fill`) continue to work without modification.

 │─"add ... strat/BB"──►│        │                  │               │

 │               │               │◄──"Breakout"───────────────────│  │
 │               │               │──new Trade(..., "Breakout")──────────►│
 │               │◄──────────────│                  │               │
```

##### Why Implemented This Way

Expansion is done at parse time (in `AddCommand`'s constructor), not at display time. This means:

1. The expanded name is what gets stored in the file. If the user runs `list`, they see `Breakout`, not `BB`.
2. The `compare` command (see below) groups by the expanded name, so `BB` and `Breakout` entered by different team members are correctly unified.
3. The `Trade` object is always constructed with a clean, canonical strategy name.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Expand at display time only**: Rejected because stored data would contain abbreviations, making the storage file harder to read and causing grouping bugs in the `compare` command.
- **Store the abbreviation and expand only in reports**: Rejected for the same reasons as above. Canonical data at the source is simpler and safer.
- **Use an enum instead of a HashMap**: Considered, but a `HashMap` is easier to extend at runtime (e.g., user-defined shortcuts in a future version) and does not require recompilation to add new shortcuts.

#### 2.2.6 [v2.0] Strategy Comparison Feature (`compare` command)

##### Overview

The `compare` command allows a trader to see performance metrics broken down by strategy. Instead of viewing one aggregate summary across all trades, the user can see exactly how each individual strategy performs — win rate, average win, average loss, and expected value (EV) — in a single command.

**Example output:**

```
compare

Strategy Comparison:

Breakout:
  Trades: 15 | Win Rate: 60% | Avg Win: 2.02R | Avg Loss: 0.95R | EV: +0.832R

Pullback:
  Trades: 20 | Win Rate: 50% | Avg Win: 1.50R | Avg Loss: 1.00R | EV: +0.250R
```

##### Architecture-Level Design

The `compare` command follows the same architecture as every other command in TradeLog. It fits into the existing structure without requiring any changes to `TradeLog`, `Parser`, `TradeList`, `Storage`, or `Ui`.

The new classes and modifications required are:

| Class            | Change                                                   |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `CompareCommand` | New class extending `Command`                            |
| `Parser`         | Add `case "compare"` to the switch                       |
| `Ui`             | Add `showStrategyComparison(Map<String, StrategyStats>)` |

A helper value object `StrategyStats` is introduced to group per-strategy metrics:

```java
class StrategyStats {
    int trades;
    int wins;
    double totalWinR;
    double totalLossR;
}
```

##### Component-Level Description

The `execute` method of `CompareCommand` performs the following steps:

1. **Guard**: If `tradeList` is empty, delegate to `ui.showSummaryEmpty()` and return.
2. **Grouping**: Iterate through all trades. For each trade, look up or create a `StrategyStats` entry in a `LinkedHashMap<String, StrategyStats>` keyed by strategy name. A `LinkedHashMap` is used (instead of `HashMap`) to preserve insertion order so strategies appear in the order they were first logged.
3. **Accumulation**: For each trade, increment the trade count. If the R:R ratio is positive, increment wins and accumulate `totalWinR`; if negative, accumulate `totalLossR`.
4. **Display**: After the loop, pass the populated map to `ui.showStrategyComparison(...)`, which formats and prints each strategy's block.

##### Design Rationale

**Why a `LinkedHashMap` and not sorting alphabetically?**
Traders tend to think of their strategies in the order they used them, not alphabetically. Preserving insertion order makes the output feel natural. A future `compare sort/alpha` variant could sort alphabetically if desired.

**Why not add grouping logic to `TradeList`?**
`TradeList` is a model class that should only manage the collection — add, delete, get, and size. Adding grouping logic there would violate single responsibility. `CompareCommand` is the correct place for this aggregation, consistent with how `SummaryCommand` handles its own calculations.

**Why not reuse `SummaryCommand`'s logic?**
`SummaryCommand` calculates one aggregate result. `CompareCommand` calculates `n` independent results (one per strategy). Though the per-strategy arithmetic is similar, merging them into a single class would make both harder to read, test, and extend independently.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **A `filterByStrategy` method on `TradeList`**: This was considered to avoid iterating through all trades in `CompareCommand`. However, it would require multiple passes (one per unique strategy), making it O(n × k) where k is the number of strategies. The single-pass accumulation approach is O(n) and simpler.
- **Storing `StrategyStats` inside `TradeList` as a cached field**: Rejected because it would couple the model to a specific reporting concept and require cache invalidation on every add/edit/delete.

1. **Platform Independence**: Must run on any OS with Java 17 or higher installed.
2. **Performance**: Statistics calculation (EV, ROI) should take <100ms for up to 2,000 trades.
3. **Data Persistence**: Immediate auto-save to `tradelog.txt` after every valid state-changing command.
4. **Offline Capability**: All trade data must be stored locally without requiring cloud connectivity.

---

## 6. Glossary

* **Ticker**: Unique symbol representing a traded asset (e.g., AAPL).
* **R:R (Risk:Reward)**: The ratio of potential profit to potential loss.
* **EV (Expected Value)**: The average amount a trader can expect to win or lose per trade.
* **ROI (Return on Investment)**: Percentage return relative to capital.
* **R-multiple**: A trade's profit or loss expressed as a multiple of the initial risk (e.g., a 2R win means the trade made twice the amount risked).
* **Strategy shortcut**: A predefined abbreviation (e.g., `BB`) that the system automatically expands to a full strategy name (e.g., `Breakout`) at parse time.

## 7. Instructions for Manual Testing

### 7.1 Initial Launch

1. Ensure the `data/` folder is empty.
2. Run `java -jar TradeLog.jar`.
3. Verify that the application creates a fresh `tradelog.txt` file.

### 7.2 Testing CRUD (v1.0)

1. **Add**: `add t/TSLA d/2026-03-18 dir/long e/200 x/220 s/190 o/win strat/Trend`
2. **Edit**: `edit 1 x/230`
3. **Delete**: `delete 1`
4. **List**: `list` (Verify it reflects changes immediately in the console).

### 7.3 Testing Strategy Shortcuts (v2.0)

1. Run: `add t/AAPL d/2026-03-18 dir/long e/150 x/165 s/140 o/win strat/BB`
2. Run: `list`
3. Verify the stored strategy name is `Breakout`, not `BB`.
4. Run with an unrecognised shortcut: `add t/TSLA d/2026-03-18 dir/long e/200 x/220 s/190 o/win strat/CustomStrat`
5. Verify the strategy is stored as `CustomStrat` unchanged.

### 7.4 Testing Strategy Comparison (v2.0)

1. Add at least two trades with different strategy names (or shortcuts).
2. Run: `compare`
3. Verify that each strategy appears as a separate block with correct trade count, win rate, and EV figures.
4. Run `compare` on an empty trade list and verify the empty-list message is shown.
